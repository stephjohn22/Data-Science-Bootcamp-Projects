E.g A picture taken from a car's camera showing the road ahead|Control commands for the car's steering, acceleration and braking systems|The self-driving car uses sensor data to understand its surroundings, detect obstacles and decide how to move safely and efficiently. The inputs are real-time data from various sensors. The outputs are the commands that control the car's steering, acceleration and braking.|\n","| 1.2  |User's viewing history, ratings and preferences|Personalised  movie or TV show recommendations for the user|The Netflix recommendation system uses data about users' past behaviour and preferences to predict what other content they might like. The inputs are data points from the user's interactions with the platform. The output is a list of recommended shows and films tailored to the user's tastes.|\n","| 1.3  |An image or digital capture of a person's signature|A verification result indicating whether the signature is genuine or forged|Signature recognition systems compare a given signature to a stored reference to verify its authenticity. The input is the signature to be checked and the output is a result indicating whether the signature is valid.|\n","| 1.4  |Patient's medical data, including symptoms, medical history, lab test results and imaging scans|A diagnosis or list of potential conditions, along with recommended treatment options|Medical diagnosis systems analyse patient data to identify possible conditions and suggest treatments. The inputs include various types of medical data that give a full picture of the patient's health. The outputs are the diagnostic results and treatment recommendations based on the analysed data.|"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l_I2f4C85yNF"},"source":["\n","2.
